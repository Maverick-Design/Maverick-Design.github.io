-My original concept for my portfolio site had to be scrapped and reworked due to difficulties trying to accomplish basic set up for the process. I ended up finding out what was causing the issue on the last night of the assignment ironically.

-Resume page did not like code from previous assignments, Most likely conflicting code; but I don't know if thats the case, it seemed like it was fine. Need to rework and have properly on webpage, however due to the time constraints and need to submit; that will have to be an activity I do over the summer. The image is just a place holder to ensure the page isn't empty/still accomplishes the idea of this website.

-I want to rework my nav bar to meet suggestions from the crit. I didn't ignore them, I just couldn't figure them out without losing appearence. Will return to later.

For About Me, I couldnt figure out how position the image along with the text to fill up that space. That dead space isn't intentional.

-Want to expand and go back to original concept now that I have a general idea of how to start it.

-Need to add a clean looking method for project descriptions. Everything I tried didnt look well/function properly.

-Overall, In a good spot; but I can still expand upon this further.
